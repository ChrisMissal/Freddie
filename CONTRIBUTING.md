# Contributing

You'd like to contribute? Great! Just a few things to be aware of.

Please add tests for any additions. You'll need your own MailChimp account (free) and will need to modify the `mailchimp.config` that is created for you from the template when a build is completed. In this file, you'll add your api key and a list ID that is called `MasterListId`.

Good luck and thanks for helping out! If you run into any problems, please submit an issue.
